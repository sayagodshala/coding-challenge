# IconEditText for Android

`IconEditText` provides a reusable view for displaying an `ImageView` with an `EditText` for `Android 4.0 +`.

## Usage

Using the `IconEditText` is easy enough, just clone the repo and <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=android+studio+add+library">add it to your project as a Library</a>.

After adding the library, you can add an `IconEditText` like so:

### XML
```xml
<!-- Note the declaration of the `widget` namespace. -->
<LinearLayout 
  ...
  xmlns:widget="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto">

  <com.kylewbanks.android.iconedittext.IconEditText
      android:layout_width="match_parent"
      android:layout_height="wrap_content"
      widget:isPassword="false"
      widget:hint="@string/username"
      widget:iconSrc="@drawable/username_icon" />

</LinearLayout>
```
#### Options

The `IconEditText` currently supports the following properties:

- isPassword `{Boolean}`: If true, will mask the EditText's input.
- hint `{String}`: The hint text to display, if any.
- iconSrc `{Drawable}`: The source of the icon image to display.

### Java

From Java, you can reference the `IconEditText` like any other view. For example, from an `Activity`:

```java
IconEditText iconEditText = (IconEditText) findViewById(...);
```

You can access the underlying `EditText` and `ImageView` like so:

```java
EditText editText = iconEditText.getEditText();
ImageView imageView = iconEditText.getImageView();
```

There is also a convenience method for accessing the `EditText`'s `Editable`:

```java
Editable editable = iconEditText.getText();
```
